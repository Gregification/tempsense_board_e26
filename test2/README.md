# Test read cell votage
> code tested and works

**target board:** arduino adafruit.

**purpose:** minimal steps needed to read cell voltages<br>

**conclusions:** takes exactly 3 or 8 fails per sucessful read. Unknown on why such a specific amount of fails.

### note

- tested using the suggested circuit in the devboards datasheet. 4 resistors in series with single a psu. tested over 10-20v, .5Amax.
